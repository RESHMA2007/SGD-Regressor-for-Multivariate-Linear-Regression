# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import libraries-Load nessary Python libraries.
2. Load Data-Read the dataset containing house details. 
3. Preprocess Data-Clean and solit the data into training and testing sets.
4. Select Features & Target-Choose input variables(features) and output variables(houseprice,occupants).
5. Train Mode-Use SGDRegressor() to train the model.
6. Make Predictions-Use the model to predict house price and occupants.
7. Evaluate Performance-Check accurancy using error metrics.
8. Improve Model-Tune settings for better accuracy.

## Program and Output
